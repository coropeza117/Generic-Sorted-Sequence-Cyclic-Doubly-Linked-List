# Generic-Sorted-Sequence-Cyclic-Doubly-Linked-List

-Accomplishments

• Generic Container Implementation

The primary accomplishment of this project is the successful implementation of a generic container for sorted sequences. The SortedSequence class is now capable of handling elements of different types (specified by the client) while maintaining the sorted order of its elements.

• Comparator Flexibility

To provide flexibility to clients, this project allows for two types of sorting:

    Natural Ordering: If the client uses the default constructor, the ADT assumes that the element type is "comparable" and uses natural ordering with the compareTo method on the elements.
    Explicit Comparator: The ADT provides a second constructor that takes an explicit "comparator" for sorting the elements. Clients can provide their own custom comparators to define the sorting criteria.

• Efficient Data Structure

The project employs a cyclic doubly-linked list with a dummy node to store elements efficiently. Special cases have been minimized in the code, leading to a straightforward and robust data structure.

• Data Structure Invariant

A comprehensive data structure invariant has been established to ensure the integrity of the SortedSequence ADT. It includes rules related to the comparator, the dummy node, cyclic linking, cursor, element count, and element ordering.

• Future Development

While the project has achieved its primary objectives, there is room for future development and enhancement. Potential areas for improvement and expansion include:

    Additional features and functionality for the SortedSequence ADT.
    Further optimization and performance enhancements.
    Expansion of the test suite to cover more edge cases and scenarios.
    Providing user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the SortedSequence.
